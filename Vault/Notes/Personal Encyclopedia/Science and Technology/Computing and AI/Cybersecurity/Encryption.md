# Encryption

## Summary
Encryption is the process of converting readable information (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) so that only authorized parties can access the original data. It is a cornerstone of data security for protecting communications, storage, and authentication mechanisms.

## Core Concepts
- **Plaintext**: Original data before encryption.
- **Ciphertext**: Encoded data produced by an encryption algorithm.
- **Keys**: Secret values used to encrypt and decrypt information.
- **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric**: Whether the same key or different keys are used for encryption and decryption.
- **Key Management**: Procedures for generating, distributing, and storing keys securely.

## Types of Encryption
### Symmetric Encryption
Uses the same key for encryption and decryption. Examples include AES and DES.

### Asymmetric Encryption
Uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt. Examples include RSA and ECC.

### Hash Functions
While not strictly encryption, cryptographic hashes provide data integrity and are often used alongside encryption.

## Applications
- Secure web traffic via HTTPS
- Protecting data at rest on disks or in databases
- Authenticating users and devices
- Safeguarding communications in messaging apps

## Security Considerations
- Key length and algorithm selection impact security strength.
- Proper implementation and random number generation are critical.
- [[Post-Quantum Cryptography]] aims to create algorithms resistant to quantum attacks.
- [[Zero Knowledge Proofs]] enable verification without revealing secrets, complementing encryption schemes.
