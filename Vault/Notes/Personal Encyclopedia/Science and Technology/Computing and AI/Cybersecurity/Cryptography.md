# Cryptography

## Summary
Cryptography is the science of securing communication and data through encoding methods that make information unreadable to unauthorized parties. It is the backbone of digital privacy, authentication, and trustâ€”used everywhere from encrypted messaging to blockchain.

## Core Concepts
| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Plaintext | Original, readable message/data |
| Ciphertext | Encrypted, unreadable version of plaintext |
| Key | A string used to encrypt or decrypt data |
| Algorithm | A formula or procedure for encryption/decryption |
| Encryption | Turning plaintext into ciphertext |
| Decryption | Reversing ciphertext back into plaintext |

## Categories of Cryptography
### Symmetric Cryptography
- Same key used to encrypt and decrypt
- Fast and efficient
- Example: AES, DES

### Asymmetric Cryptography (Public Key)
- Public key to encrypt, private key to decrypt
- Enables secure communication between strangers
- Example: RSA, ECC

### Hash Functions
- One-way operations
- Used for integrity, digital fingerprints
- Example: SHA-256, MD5 (deprecated)

### Post-Quantum Cryptography
- Designed to resist quantum computer attacks
- Ongoing field of research
- Example: Lattice-based schemes, NTRU

## Historical Snapshot
- Caesar Cipher (Shift cipher) â€” Ancient Rome
- Enigma Machine â€” WWII German encryption device
- Diffie-Hellman â€” First public key exchange (1976)
- RSA â€” Groundbreaking asymmetric algorithm (1977)
- AES â€” Current global standard for encryption

## Common Algorithms
| Algorithm | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AES | Symmetric | Fast and secure for data-at-rest |
| RSA | Asymmetric | Secure key exchange & digital signatures |
| SHA-256 | Hash | One-way hashing (Bitcoin, SSL certs) |
| ECC | Asymmetric | Efficient with smaller keys |
| Blowfish | Symmetric | Fast but older |
| PBKDF2 | Key Derivation | Used in password hashing |

## Real-World Applications
- HTTPS & SSL certificates
- Encrypted emails (PGP, S/MIME)
- End-to-End encrypted messaging (Signal, WhatsApp)
- Cryptocurrency wallets and transactions
- Secure health and legal records
- Encrypted file systems and drives

## Risks & Limitations
- Poor key management
- Algorithm backdoors or vulnerabilities
- Deprecated algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA-1)
- Social engineering & phishing bypass crypto
- Quantum threats to RSA & ECC in the future
