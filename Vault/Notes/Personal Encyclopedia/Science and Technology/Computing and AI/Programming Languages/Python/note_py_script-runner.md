## 🔍 Running Python Scripts — Overview & Best Practices

There are multiple ways to run Python scripts depending on the context (terminal, editor, notebook). The main options:

### ▶️ Run via Terminal (PowerShell, Bash, CMD)

```bash
python script_name.py
```

- Must be in the script’s directory or provide full path
- Use `python3` if `python` is mapped to something else (common on macOS/Linux)

### ▶️ Run from Inside Python

Inside the REPL:

```python
exec(open("script_name.py").read())
```

Mostly for testing or exploration. Not the cleanest method for full runs.

### ▶️ Run from VS Code

- Open the file
- Click “Run Python File” in the top-right or use:

```bash
Ctrl + F5  # Run without debugging
F5         # Run with debugging
```

Make sure you’ve selected the correct interpreter:  
`Ctrl+Shift+P → Python: Select Interpreter`

### ▶️ Run as Executable Script (Optional)

Add a shebang at the top (Unix systems only):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

Then:

```bash
chmod +x script_name.py
./script_name.py
```

Useful when scripting in Linux environments.

## 🧪 Experimental Log

### 💻 Trial 1: Running from PowerShell

```bash
python hello.py
```

→ Worked. No issues.  
Tested with a simple `print("Hello from PowerShell")`.

### ⚠️ Trial 2: Forgot to CD into Directory

Running from the wrong path caused:

```text
python: can't open file 'hello.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

Reminder: terminal context matters. Use `cd` or right-click → “Open in Terminal.”

---

### 🧪 Trial 3: VS Code Integration

- Opened file in VS Code
- Prompted to install Python extension
- Selected interpreter → top bar “Run Python File” worked as expected

Also tested the debugger. `F5` triggers breakpoint mode — useful for step-by-step learning.

### 💡 Ideas for Automating

- Might create a `run.ps1` or `run.bat` file to simplify multi-script workflows
- Could explore `watchdog` or `entr` to auto-run on file save

## 🌀 Reflection Dump

- I keep forgetting that the terminal needs to be “in” the same folder as the file. That mental model still hasn’t fully set.
- I like that VS Code just *knows* what to do with Python once the extension is installed.
- Still unsure if I should always use `Ctrl + F5` or if there’s a reason to debug by default.
