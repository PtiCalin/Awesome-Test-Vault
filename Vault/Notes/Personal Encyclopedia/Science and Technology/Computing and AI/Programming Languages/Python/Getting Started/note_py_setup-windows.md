## 🔍 Installing Python on Windows — Key Notes & Takeaways

Installing Python on Windows is a little more visible than expected — installers, dialogs, choices. Most of it works if you trust the defaults, but a few key steps matter more than others.

### 🧭 What I Needed to Do

1. Download from: [python.org/downloads/windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
2. Launched the `.exe` installer.
3. **Checked** the box for “Add Python to PATH.” Critical.
4. Went with “Customize Installation” just to see — left most defaults untouched.
5. Installed.

After install, opened PowerShell and ran:

```powershell
python --version
```

→ Output: `Python 3.13.3`  
That confirmed the install and that the PATH variable was set correctly.

---

### 🧠 Key Points

- Always check the “Add Python to PATH” box — missing it leads to hard-to-debug errors.
- Python installs both `python` and `pip` by default.
- Avoid the Windows Store version. It’s a different experience and not always consistent.
- Custom install lets you choose advanced options, but defaults are usually fine.
- Install location matters — good to make a note of it.

## 🧪 Experimental Log

### 💻 First Run: Clean Install

Went through the installer with PATH checked. Install completed cleanly.

Ran:

```powershell
python
```

→ Opened the REPL. Typed `print("hello world")`. Output appeared as expected.

Checked pip:

```powershell
pip --version
```

→ Also worked immediately. No manual installation needed.

---

### 🛠 Editor Setup

Installed VS Code.

- Opened a `.py` file.
- Got prompted to install the Python extension.
- Used `Ctrl+Shift+P → Python: Select Interpreter` to link VS Code to the new install.

Worked without issues.

---

## 🌀 Thoughts
- I hesitate at the “Add Python to PATH” checkbox. It feels important but unclear.
- The fact that it works from PowerShell after install surprised me.
- Noticed how VS Code quietly fixes a lot of setup pain.
- Still unsure when I’ll need to mess with advanced install options. For now I just stuck to defaults.
