## ✍️ 🧠 YAML – Yet Another Markup Language

### 🧾 Overview

YAML (rhymes with "camel") stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language. It’s a human-readable data serialization language commonly used for configuration files, data exchange, and applications that require structured input/output. Unlike XML or JSON, YAML prioritizes simplicity and readability.

---

### 🛠️ Core Characteristics

- File Extension: .yaml or .yml
- Syntax Style: Indentation-based (uses spaces, not tabs)
- Data Types Supported: Strings, numbers, booleans, arrays (sequences), dictionaries (mappings), nulls
- Main Purpose: Data configuration and serialization

---

### 🧱 Basic Syntax Elements

🔹 Key-Value Pair (Mapping)

```yaml
name: PtiCalin
language: YAML
```

🔹 Lists (Sequence)

```yaml
tools:
  - GitHub
  - Obsidian
  - VS Code
```

🔹 Nested Structures

```yaml
user:
  name: PtiCalin
  projects:
    - VaultOS
    - Veridonia
```

🔹 Multiline Strings

```yaml
bio: >
  YAML is easy to read,
  supports multiline values,
  and is used everywhere.
```

🔹 Comments

```yaml
# This is a comment
```

---

🌐 Common Use Cases

- Configuration Files: .github/workflows/, docker-compose.yml, obsidian.json
- CI/CD Pipelines: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
- Cloud & Infrastructure: Kubernetes manifests
- Metadata Definitions: Obsidian frontmatter

---

⚠️ Gotchas & Best Practices

- Always use spaces (never tabs)
- Indentation matters — inconsistent spacing will break parsing
- Strings with special characters should be wrapped in quotes
- Avoid complex structures where readability breaks down

---

📚 YAML in the Vault Ecosystem

- In the Awesome Test Vault and VaultOS, YAML is foundational for:
- File metadata (via frontmatter)
- Plugin configurations
- Structured templates (e.g., learning logs, story blocks, project tickets)


📌 Reference Snippet (Frontmatter Template)
