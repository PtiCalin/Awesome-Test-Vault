## 📚 Glossary for Core Structures

    - A language in which the type of all variables is known at compile time; Java and C++ are statically typed.

    - A class that inherits from another class, also called a child class; for example, a Car is a subclass of a Vehicle.

    - A database type that captures and stores the date and time when a row is updated
- transaction, atomic [[ACID and transactions](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-databases-2/acid-and-transactions-2)]
    - A transaction must be indivisible; pieces of it can’t be separated out.
- transaction, consistent [[ACID and transactions](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-databases-2/acid-and-transactions-2)]
    - Whatever a transaction does, it must leave the database in a valid or consistent state.
- transaction, database [[Indexes, transactions, and stored procedures](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-databases-2/indexes-transactions-and-stored-procedures)]
    - A group of queries or statements treated as a block of activities; if one of the components fails for any reason, the whole group of statements is not executed, and anything that is partially completed is rolled back.
- transaction, durable [[ACID and transactions](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-databases-2/acid-and-transactions-2)]
    - The information changed in a transaction must actually get written to the database.
- transaction, isolated [[ACID and transactions](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-databases-2/acid-and-transactions-2)]
    - While activities in a transaction are being completed, nothing else can make changes to the data involved.
- tree [[Introduction to tree data structures](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-data-structures-2019/introduction-to-tree-data-structures)]
    - A collection of nodes in which a node might be linked to one, two, or more nodes
- tree, binary search [[Understand binary search trees](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-data-structures-2019/understand-binary-search-trees)]

- use case scenario [[Identifying the scenarios](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-object-oriented-design-3/identifying-the-scenarios)]

    - A database data type that contains a variable-length character string
- variable, static [[Static attributes and methods](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-object-oriented-design-3/static-attributes-and-methods)]

- visibility [[Creating class diagrams: Behaviors](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-object-oriented-design-3/creating-class-diagrams-behaviors)]
    - Whether a method or attribute is exposed to other classes; in general, this can be public (accessible by other objects) or private (not accessible by other objects).
