# Networks

## üß≠ Summary
A network is a collection of interconnected devices that communicate and share resources. In computing, networks allow data to be exchanged between systems‚Äîlocally, across buildings, or across the entire globe.

Networks are the infrastructure behind the internet, emails, video calls, blockchain, multiplayer games, and every cloud service.

## üß† Core Concepts
| Concept | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Node | Any device connected to a network (e.g., computers, routers, servers) |
| Packet | A formatted unit of data carried across a network |
| Protocol | A set of rules that define how data is transmitted (e.g., TCP/IP) |
| IP Address | A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network |
| Port | A logical channel for network communication on a device |
| Bandwidth | The maximum data rate a network can handle |
| Latency | The delay in data transmission across a network |

## üèóÔ∏è Types of Networks
| Type | Description | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LAN | Local Area Network | A small geographic area (home, office) |
| WAN | Wide Area Network | Spans cities or countries (e.g., the Internet) |
| PAN | Personal Area Network | Close-range devices (Bluetooth, AirDrop) |
| MAN | Metropolitan Area Network | City-wide (university campus, urban broadband) |
| VPN | Virtual Private Network | Secure, encrypted tunnel over a public network |

## üì° Network Topologies
| Topology | Layout |
| --- | --- |
| Star | All nodes connected to a central hub |
| Bus | All nodes share a common backbone |
| Ring | Each node connected to two others, forming a loop |
| Mesh | Every node connects directly to multiple others |
| Hybrid | Combination of two or more topologies |

## üîÅ Protocols You Should Know
| Protocol | Use |
| --- | --- |
| TCP/IP | Foundation of internet communication |
| HTTP/HTTPS | Web browsing |
| FTP/SFTP | File transfer |
| SMTP/IMAP/POP3 | Email services |
| DNS | Domain name to IP translation |
| DHCP | Automatic IP address assignment |

## üîê Network Security Basics
| Concept | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Firewall | Blocks unauthorized access |
| Encryption | Protects data in transit |
| MAC Filtering | Allows only approved devices |
| Intrusion Detection System (IDS) | Monitors suspicious activity |
| Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) | Strengthens access control |
