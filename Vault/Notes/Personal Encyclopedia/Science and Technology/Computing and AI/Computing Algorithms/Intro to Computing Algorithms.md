An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions designed to solve a problem or perform a computation. Algorithms form the core of computer science, enabling everything from simple arithmetic to advanced AI.

They are logic engines—abstract machines that transform input into output by following a precise, finite process.

## 🧠 Core Concepts
| Concept | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Algorithm | A finite, ordered sequence of steps to solve a specific task |
| Input | The data the algorithm receives |
| Output | The result produced after processing the input |
| Deterministic | Produces the same output for the same input |
| Non-deterministic | May produce different results with same input (e.g., probabilistic algorithms) |
| Efficiency | Time and space used to complete the task (Big O notation) |

## 🔢 Common Types of Algorithms
| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sorting | Arrange data in a specific order | Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort |
| Searching | Find an element in data | Binary Search, Linear Search |
| Recursive | Solve by calling itself with subproblems | Fibonacci, Factorial |
| Greedy | Make optimal local choice at each step | Dijkstra’s, Huffman Coding |
| Divide & Conquer | Split problem into smaller chunks | Merge Sort, Quick Sort |
| Dynamic Programming | Solve complex problems by breaking into overlapping subproblems | Knapsack, Memoized Fibonacci |
| Backtracking | Explore possible solutions by trial and error | Sudoku Solver, N-Queens |
| Machine Learning Algorithms | Learn patterns from data | Decision Trees, K-Means, Neural Networks |

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity (Big O)
| Complexity | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| O(1) | Accessing an array index | Constant time |
| O(log n) | Binary search | Logarithmic |
| O(n) | Linear search | Scales directly |
| O(n log n) | Merge sort | Efficient sorting |
| O(n²) | Bubble sort | Nested loops |
| O(2ⁿ) | Recursive subset generation | Exponential |

## 🛠️ Real-World Examples
- Google Search → PageRank (graph-based algorithm)
- Spotify Recommendations → Collaborative filtering algorithms
- GPS Routing → Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Bank Fraud Detection → Pattern recognition algorithms
- Healthcare Diagnosis → Decision tree + neural nets

## 🧪 Sample Algorithm (Pseudocode: Linear Search)
```text
function linearSearch(list, target):
  for each item in list:
    if item == target:
      return index
  return -1
```
