# ⚙️ Macros

## 🧭 Summary
A macro is a rule or pattern that expands into a larger set of instructions. In computing, macros automate repetitive tasks by recording a series of actions or commands and executing them as a single command or trigger. They exist in software from spreadsheets to IDEs, text editors to operating systems.

## 🧠 Core Concepts
| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Macro | A predefined sequence of instructions that automate tasks. |
| Trigger | The action or event that activates the macro (e.g., hotkey, command). |
| Scripting Macro | A macro that includes conditional logic and variables (e.g., AutoHotkey). |
| Recording Macro | A macro that records user actions without coding (e.g., Excel macros). |

## 📍 Common Use Cases
- 🔁 Automating repetitive text input or UI actions
- 📈 Creating dynamic formulas and tasks in Excel
- 🧪 Custom keyboard shortcuts in IDEs (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ)
- 🧠 Building workflows in Notion, Obsidian, and Zapier
- ⌨️ Gaming macros for repeated keystrokes

## 💬 Examples
### 🧮 Excel Macro (VBA)
```vb
Sub HelloWorld()
  MsgBox "Hello, world!"
End Sub
```

### ⌨️ AutoHotkey Script
```ahk
::sig::Best regards,  
Charlie
```

### 🧠 Templater Macro (Obsidian)
```markdown
<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD") %> — Daily reflection
```

## 🛠️ Popular Macro Tools & Platforms
| Tool | Domain | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Excel VBA | Office productivity | Automates spreadsheets |
| AutoHotkey | Windows desktop | Full scripting language |
| Keyboard Maestro | macOS | GUI automation |
| Templater (Obsidian) | Note-taking | Logic + dynamic templates |
| Zapier / Make | Web workflows | No-code automation |
| Elgato Stream Deck | Hardware | Macro pads for streamers and productivity nerds |

## 🧱 Macros vs. Scripts
| Feature | Macros | Scripts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code-based? | Optional | Always |
| Designed for... | End-user automation | Programmable logic |
| Use Case | Recording UI actions | Backend/system logic |

## 🔐 Risks & Best Practices
- Avoid macros from untrusted sources (can contain malicious code)
- Comment and document your macros
- Use naming conventions for clarity
- Limit scope and permissions where possible (sandboxing)
